# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to create expense transactions by taking or uploading photos of receipts, invoices, or bank statements. The system will use AI to automatically extract transaction details from the image, reducing manual data entry and improving the user experience for expense tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a FinFlow user, I want to create expenses by taking a photo of a receipt, so that I can quickly log transactions without manual typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the expense creation flow THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Add from Photo"
2. WHEN a user selects "Add from Photo" THEN the system SHALL allow them to either take a new photo or select from their device gallery
3. WHEN a user captures or selects an image THEN the system SHALL process the image and extract transaction details automatically
4. WHEN the AI processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display the extracted transaction data in list view like in transactions page
5. WHEN the extracted data is displayed THEN the user SHALL be able to review before saving
6. WHEN the extracted data is displayed THEN the user SHALL be able to click on a transaction and modify
7. WHEN the user is satisfied with the extracted data THEN the user SHALL be able to save the transaction
8. WHEN the user saves the transaction THEN the system SHALL create a new transaction record in the database


### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a FinFlow user, I want the system to accurately extract transaction information from receipt images, so that I don't have to manually enter all the details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image contains a receipt THEN the system SHALL extract the merchant name, amount, date, and suggest an appropriate category
2. WHEN multiple transactions are detected in a single image THEN the system SHALL present all transactions for individual review
3. WHEN the image quality is poor or unreadable THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message and suggest retaking the photo
4. WHEN transaction details are extracted THEN the system SHALL map them to the existing transaction schema (name, amount, type, category, transactionAt)
5. IF the AI cannot determine a field with confidence THEN the system SHALL leave that field empty for manual entry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a FinFlow user, I want clear feedback during photo processing, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photo processing begins THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with progress information
2. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message with suggested next steps
3. WHEN processing succeeds THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to the transaction review screen
4. WHEN the user navigates away during processing THEN the system SHALL handle the interruption gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a FinFlow user, I want clear feedback when photo processing is unavailable, so that I understand when I need an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL disable the "Add from Photo" option
2. WHEN the photo option is disabled THEN the system SHALL show a clear message that internet is required
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically enable the photo option
4. WHEN processing fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL suggest checking internet connection
5. WHEN the user attempts photo processing offline THEN the system SHALL gracefully redirect to manual entry
